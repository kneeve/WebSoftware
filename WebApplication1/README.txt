Comments to Evaluators:

The purpose of homework 2 is to gain more experience with HTML, Bootstrap, and CSS. Homework 2 was working off of 
Homework 1 involving the incorporation of previously created HTML files. 

I switched into Web Software Architecture just this last Friday so this assignment was the first assignment that I have done in this class. 

It allowed me to learn how to use HTML to create a nice looking webpage with minimal functionality. I did enjoy this assignment and I hope I have completed it with
the correct functionality with the information that I have learned on my own time.

Design Choices:
A drop down menu in the navigation bar was chosen for ease of finding information without an extensively stretching menu. Only minimal colors were used as of now in order to 
maintain a clean and a universally pleasing aesthetic.

I liked the default look of the windows generated HTML theme so I mainly stuck with that design choice. I changed the top menu bar to be a darker color and also
changed some links in various webpages to be a different color so that they would more clearly be clicked.

Bootstrap Uses:
- Tables
- Progress bar
- Dropdown


Consulted Peers:

List any peers (or other people) in the class (or outside for that matter) that you talked with about the project for more than one minute.
